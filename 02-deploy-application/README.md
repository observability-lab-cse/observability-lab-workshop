# Deploying the applications into AKS

> 🎯 **Goal:**
>
> 1. Getting your applications up and running end-to-end and gaining an understanding of each component.
>
> 2. Being able to observe the running applications and getting familiar with out-of-the-box monitoring capabilities of the AKS cluster.

## 🚀  Deploy Application

> **📌 Starting point 📌**
>
> Check out this branch [/02-deploy-application](https://github.com/observability-lab-cse/observability-lab/tree/section/02-deploy-application), in case you have not done the previous section, and run `make` from the root folder.

Now, let's start deploying the individual services in our application. There are three components to our solution:

- 📱 Devices API: A Java application with an API that allows us to create and delete devices.
- ⚙️ Devices State Manager: A service which manages the state of the devices in the storage. It updates the device temperature value with the most recent one generated by the Devices Data Simulator..
- 🌡️ Devices Data Simulator: Simulates devices that publish their temperature.

> 📝 **Note:**  Make sure you have sourced the `.env` file before you continue from here.

```bash
source .env
```

```sh
az acr login --name "acr$ENV_PROJECT_NAME".azurecr.io
```

Before we start deploying the application, let's set up all the secrets in the cluster with an easy command.

```sh
make deploy_secret_store
```

We will not go into more details on how to handle secrets in a K8s cluster, as this is not the main point of this workshop. But if you are interested, we leverage the Secret Store CSI driver to pull secrets from the Key Vault resource. You can read more about this [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/csi-secrets-store-driver).

### Deploy: 📱 Devices API

Let's start by deploying the Devices API application. The code for this service can be found [here](https://github.com/observability-lab-cse/observability-lab/tree/section/02-deploy-application/sample-application/devices-api). It's a Java Spring Boot REST API that allows you to list, create, update, and delete devices from your device registry.

The first step is to build and push the image to the registry.

<!-- TODO: from where to run the below commands-->

```sh
TAG="latest"
cd sample-application/devices-api

docker build -t "acr$ENV_PROJECT_NAME.azurecr.io/devices-api":"$TAG" .
docker push "acr$ENV_PROJECT_NAME.azurecr.io/devices-api":"$TAG"
```

Now, it’s time to deploy it to our Kubernetes cluster. But first, we need to connect to our cluster. Here’s how:

```sh
AKS_NAME=$(az aks list -g "$ENV_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME" --query "[0].name" -o tsv)
az aks get-credentials \
--resource-group "$ENV_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME" \
--name "$AKS_NAME"
```

Now that we’re connected, we’re ready to deploy the devices-api. You’ll find the devices-api Kubernetes deployment manifest below or in the [k8s-files folder](https://github.com/observability-lab-cse/observability-lab/blob/section/02-deploy-application/k8s-files/devices-api-deployment.yaml). Don’t forget to replace `${project-name}` with the value of your `$ENV_PROJECT_NAME`. Then, deploy it using the following command from the root repository folder:

```
kubectl apply -f k8s-files/devices-api-deployment.yaml
```

Let’s ensure that your Devices API is up and running smoothly. You can do this by using the `kubectl get pods` command. If everything is working as expected, this command should report that the `devices-api` pod is in the `Running` status.

### Deploy: ⚙️ Devices State Manager

Next on our agenda is the deployment of the Devices State Manager service. You can access the source code for this service [here](https://github.com/observability-lab-cse/observability-lab/tree/section/02-deploy-application/sample-application/device-manager/DeviceManager). This .NET application plays a critical role by updating the temperature records of devices in the database as data flows in from each device.

As with our previous steps, we'll need to build the image and ensure it's pushed to your Azure Container Registry (ACR).

```sh
TAG="latest"
cd sample-application/devices-state-manager/DevicesStateManager

docker build -t "acr$ENV_PROJECT_NAME.azurecr.io/devices-state-manager":"$TAG" .
docker push "acr$ENV_PROJECT_NAME.azurecr.io/devices-state-manager":"$TAG"
```

Just like we did for the devices-api, you’ll find the deployment manifest for the devices-state-manager in the same [k8s-files folder](https://github.com/observability-lab-cse/observability-lab/blob/section/02-deploy-application/k8s-files/devices-state-manager-deployment.yaml) or below. Remember to replace `${project-name}` with the value of your `$ENV_PROJECT_NAME`. Then, from the root repository folder, deploy it using the following command:

```sh
kubectl apply -f k8s-files/devices-state-manager-deployment.yaml
```

Let’s also make sure that your Devices State Manager is functioning properly. Run again `kubectl get pods` command and check that the `devices-state-manager` pod is in the `Running` status.

### Deploy: 🌡️ Devices Data Simulator

To generate data from virtual devices for testing purposes, we're deploying [the Device Simulator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/azure-samples/iot-telemetry-simulator/azure-iot-device-telemetry-simulator/). This simulator effectively generates temperature data at defined intervals for each virtual device and transmits this data as messages to Event Hub.

However, before we can start generating data, we need to create some devices in our device registry. To do this, we’ll use the Devices API.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Click here to see how to find your Devices API.</summary>

```sh
kubectl get service devices-api-service -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'
```

</details>

Once you’ve located your Devices API, open your browser and navigate to: `<your_devices_api_ip>:8080`. This will open the Swagger UI for the Devices API. Locate `POST` endpoint, and create some devices.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Click here to learn how to create a device using the Swagger UI.</summary>

![devices-api-swagger-ui](./images/devices-api-swagger-ui.png)

</details>

We’re now ready to bring our virtual devices to life by simulating data for them! You have two options to do this:

1. Use the provided YAML: Substitute `DEVICE_NAMES_PLACEHOLDER` with your list of device names in the YAML file provided below.
2. Use our handy bash script: This script automatically picks up your device names and deploys the simulator. You can run it with the following command:

```sh
make deploy-devices-data-simulator
```

> NOTE: Remember, any time you make changes to your list of devices (such as creating, deleting, or updating a device), you’ll need to update the list of device names in the simulator deployment. Alternatively, you can simply re-run the `make deploy-devices-data-simulator` command to keep everything in sync.

## 📦 Out of the box observability

Let’s embark on a journey of discovery and see what Azure AKS has to offer right out of the box! Head over to the Azure Portal and navigate to your AKS cluster. Try to find out:

- AKS level metrics. These are the vital signs of your AKS, providing valuable insights into its performance.
- An overview of your pods and services. This is where you’ll see the heart of your operations.
- Live logs. While they don’t maintain a history, they offer a real-time glimpse into your system’s activities.

If you’re finding it a bit challenging, don’t worry! Here are some screenshots to guide you:

<details markdown="1">

<details markdown="1">

![AKS-monitoring-overview](./images/AKS-pod-live-logs.png)

</details>

Now this looks all good and great. There is an awesome overview of our cluster, but other than the logs (in a, let's be honest, rather unpratical format), we have no real visibility on the applications. No way to know if messages are being sent across the system, etc.
But luckily there is a simple way to fix this, which we will look at in the next chapter.
