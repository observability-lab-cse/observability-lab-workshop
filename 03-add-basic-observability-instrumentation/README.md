# Adding Basic Observability Instrumentation

> Goal: Exploring different options to instrument applications with standard tooling and easily integrate them into Azure for data collection and observability.

<!--
In this section we are going to build the observability solution step by step by using automatic OpenTelemetry instrumentation.

1. OpenTelemetry collector introduction and ref to lower section with comparison to alternatives
2. Auto instrumentation of .Net application
3. Auto instrumentation of Java application

Additional topics:

- OtelCollector and the alternatives quick comparison. -->

<!-- Order of chapters and when to deploy otel collector -->

Now, let's dive into the exciting part of this workshop.

The goal of this section is to instrument the application we developed earlier to gain more visibility into its availability and health.

There are a few steps we need to take to achive this:

1. Provision necessary resources.
<!-- Consider provisioning manually, potentially. -->
2. Set up a mechanism to send application level telemetry data to these created resources.

There are multiple ways to instrument your application, or even whole solution in more general terms.
Our application is running in AKS, which already provides workload level visibility regarding the health of the resources. However, what we're missing, as previously mentioned, are application-level insights.

When we look at the AKS workloads, pods, or other data tables, it doesn't provide insights into how these pods communicate with each other, or with other services, and whether their communication is successful.

To gain this lower level of visibility into our solution, we have various tools at our disposal. To demonstrate how easily you can instrument an existing application, we'll explore an auto-instrumentation approach using OpenTelemetry's automated instrumentation agents and the OpenTelemetry collector to send telemetry data upstream. ðŸ˜‰

> Note: The [section below](TODO) offers a comparison of different approaches for instrumenting applications, along with links to relevant resources and samples.

But first, let's provision our resources so that we have a destination to send the newly gathered data.

## Provision Resources

Can you guess the first resource we need for this section? If you said Application Insights, then ding, ding, ding... 100 points to you!

As expected, we require Application Insights. However, we'll also need a Log Analytics workspace to support our Application Insights instance.

> If you're curious about how Log Analytics and Application Insights work together, explore this section [Azure 101](tbd) for more information.

- First, let's create a Log Analytics workspace in our resource group. Feel free to use either the Azure portal or any other tools for this task.

- Afterwards, you can create an Application Insights resource, and make sure to specifically select the just-created Log Analytics workspace as the backing instance for the new Application Insights resource.

## OpenTelemetry

As mentioned, there are many ways to instrument applications. Some require writing more custom code, some less.

For this workshop, let's use an approach that requires no changes to the application code, as it will come in handy when working with preexisting applications.
To do so, we will make use of the OpenTelemetry Auto instrumentation for different programming languages and the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/).

### Configure Applications

For auto-instrumentation, our applications need a small "agent" running alongside
the service to be able to gather telemetry data from common logging, metric, and tracing libraries.

Let's have a look at the applications we would like to instrument.
   
- [devices-state-manager](TODO) is written in C#. Following the instructions on [OpenTelemetry Auto-instrumentation for C#](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/net/automatic/), you can auto-instrument the plain vanilla version of the Docker file in such a way that we can scrape the logs and send them to the OpenTelemetry collector.
- [devices-api](TODO) is a Java application. The same instructions for Java services can be found here [OpenTelemetry Auto-instrumentation for Java](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation). Like before, try adding the auto-instrumentation Agent into the build so we can expose all the metrics.

In case you have issues, you can see how to do it when opening the section below or check out the next section's [branch]().

Now, let's build the images with the agent and add a new tag to it, so that we know which images are auto-instrumented. TODO

### Configure Deployment

For the agent to properly connect to the Collector, there are a few environment variables that need to be set. For now, let's only set the mandatory ones.

In the case of the Java agent, not much is needed.
