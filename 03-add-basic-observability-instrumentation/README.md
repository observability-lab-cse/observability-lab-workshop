# 3. Adding Basic Observability Instrumentation

>üéØ **Goal:** Exploring different options to instrument applications with standard tooling and easily integrate them into Azure for data collection and observability.

Now, let's dive into the exciting part of this workshop.

The goal of this section is to instrument the application we developed earlier to gain more visibility into its availability and health.

There are a few steps we need to take to achieve this:

1. ‚öôÔ∏è Provision necessary resources.
2. üõ∞Ô∏è Set up a mechanism to send application level telemetry data to these created resources.

There are multiple ways to instrument your application, or even whole solution in more general terms.
Our application is running in AKS, which already provides workload level visibility regarding the health of the resources. However, what we're missing, as previously mentioned, are application-level insights.

When we look at the AKS workloads, pods, or other data tables, it doesn't provide insights into how these pods communicate with each other, or with other services, and whether their communication is successful.

To gain this lower level of visibility into our solution, we have various tools at our disposal. To demonstrate how easily you can instrument an existing application, we'll explore an auto-instrumentation approach using OpenTelemetry's automated instrumentation agents and the OpenTelemetry collector to send telemetry data upstream. üòâ

> üìù **Note:**  This article ["Cluster observability"](https://internal.playbook.microsoft.com/code-with-platformops/capabilities/observability/k8s-observability/?h=instrumentation+based#individual-instrumentation-based-approaches) on the PlatformOps Playbook offers a comparison of a few other  approaches for instrumenting applications, along with links to relevant resources and samples.

But first, let's provision our resources so that we have a destination to send the newly gathered data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Provision Resources

> In case you have not completed the previous section, check out this branch: [section/02-deploy-application](https://github.com/observability-lab-cse/observability-lab/tree/section/02-deploy-application), and run `make` from the root folder.

Can you guess the first resource we need for this section? If you said Application Insights, then üõéÔ∏è ding, ding, ding... üíØ points to you!

As expected, we require Application Insights. However, we'll also need a Log Analytics workspace to support our Application Insights instance.

1. First, let's create a Log Analytics workspace in our resource group. Feel free to use either the Azure portal or any other tools for this task.
1. Afterwards, you can create an Application Insights resource, and make sure to specifically select the just-created Log Analytics workspace as the backing instance for the new Application Insights resource.

## üõ∞Ô∏è OpenTelemetry

As mentioned, there are many ways to instrument applications. Some require writing more custom code, some less.

For this workshop, let's use an approach that requires no changes to the application code, as it will come in handy when working with preexisting applications.
To do so, we will make use of the OpenTelemetry Auto instrumentation for different programming languages and the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/).

This will require our application to publish their telemetry data via [otlp protocol](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/protocol/) (or any other of the available [receivers](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/#receivers)) to the collector, which can than send them upstream into one or more of its [exporters](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/#exporters). The collector allows you to do much more than just forwards telemetry data from your application to Azure for example. Using [processors](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/#processors) and [connectors](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/#connectors), there is a lot of preprocessing you can do before sending your data to is end location.
However this is a conversation for another time or come back later when this workshop has extended to also cover these topics üòâ.

> üìù **Note:** One final note on this topic however, for people that wonder why you would want to pre process your data. So in scenarios when your cluster is not an AKS cluster but running on an edge device which low connectivity or if your applications produce a lot of telemetry your would like to filter/control before being send upstream these features of the collector come in very handy. SO if you are interested go check out the [opentelemetry-collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main) and [opentelemetry-collector-contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main) for all the options and tools you have at your disposal.

Now that we know how we want to instrument our solution, lets start by auto-instrumenting our applications and then deploying the new version along side an OpenTelemetry Collector

### üì± Configure Applications

For auto-instrumentation, our applications need a small "agent" running alongside the service to be able to gather telemetry data from common logging, metric, and tracing libraries.

Let's have a look at the applications we would like to instrument.

- The [devices-state-manager](https://github.com/observability-lab-cse/observability-lab/tree/section/03-add-basic-observability-instrumentation/sample-application/devices-state-manager) is written in C#. Following the instructions on [OpenTelemetry Auto-instrumentation for C#](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/net/automatic/), you can auto-instrument the plain vanilla version of the Docker file in such a way that we can scrape the logs and send them to the OpenTelemetry collector.
- The [devices-api](https://github.com/observability-lab-cse/observability-lab/tree/section/03-add-basic-observability-instrumentation/sample-application/devices-api) is a Java application. The same instructions for Java services can be found here [OpenTelemetry Auto-instrumentation for Java](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation). Like before, try adding the auto-instrumentation Agent into the build so we can expose all the metrics.

In case you have issues, you can see how to do it when opening the section below or check out the next section's [branch](TODO).

Now, let's build the images with the agent and add a new tag to it, so that we know which images are auto-instrumented. TODO

### üê≥ Configure Deployment

For the agent to properly connect to the Collector, there are a few environment variables that need to be set. For now, let's only set the mandatory ones.

In the case of the Java agent, not much is needed.

### üéª Deployment Otel collector and auto-instrumented Application

Before we redeploy our applications, lets have a look at the OpenTelemetry Collector deployment and how we need to configure it.

Let's if given the documentation ["Install Collector"](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/installation/) on how to deploy the collector you can manage to create its deployment and configure it correctly.

<details markdown="1">
<summary> üîç Hints: </summary>
A few question that could guide you to figure out what you need to configure:

1. What is our upstream location? Hence, what exporter do we need?
1. Does our exporter need specific configuration?
1. What do we want to export and where to?

</details>
If you managed, great! Else, not to worry. Open the below section and you have the deployment yaml as well as the configuration for your collector. Go ahead and deploy that, before you redeploy your applications.
